<h2 style="text-align: center">JSettlers3 Design Concepts</h2>
<p>This version of JSettlers3 is designed to be a client/server application. JSettlersServer[version].jar
	will launch a network server application which accepts connections from clients using the TCP protocol.
	JSettlersClient[version].jar is used to connect to a server application using the TCP protocol.
	The combined client/server jar file, JSettlers[-version].jar, can start a server using the TCP
	protocol, an internal messaging protocol, or both, and can connect to an external server via TCP
	or the local server using internal messaging.</p>

<p>In all cases, coordination between the client User Interface, and the server game control is
	performed by sending and receiving messages. The goal is that the client should have no awareness
	of game play, simply responding to server messages, and that the server should have no knowledge
	of the display or user interaction except to the extent that these actions are communicated via a message.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to describe the sequence of messages that typically occur during
	game play. For the exact description of each message, consult the Javadocs for that message.
	Whatever message queuing system is used to exchange messages, messages must be serialized and
	deserialized faithfully, so that each message received is an exact duplicate of the message sent.</p>

<h3>There are several phases to using JSettlers3. </h3>

<p>In the first phase of operation of JSettlers2 the game server and the client application must be
	launched. These two things can be done in any order, but if the client application is launched
	first its UI will permit a user to launch the game server from the client application. The
	command-line method of launching the server will start a network based game server that will
	communicate with its clients via the TCP protocol. If the game server is launched from the client
	application, a user has the option of launching a server that can communicate with the client
	only via an internal communication channel that does not use TCP. In this case, only the client
	(and robots) will be able to participate in "practice" games.
</p>
<h4>A description of the JSettlers3 connection model can be found <a href="">here</a>.</h4>

<h3><em>Handshake</em> phase</h3>
<p>In the next phase of operation, the client must connect to a game server. If the game server was
	launched as a local "practice" server, the client automatically initiates the connection.
	Otherwise, the client will provide a UI for the user to select a network host and port of the
	server to connect with. The client also requests a user nickname; in the case of the "practice"
	server the user nickname is automatically set to "Player".
</p>
<p>
	Immediately after connecting to a server, the <em>handshake</em> phase begins by the client sending an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCVersion.html">SOCVersion</a>
	message to the server. The message will indicate the version and build string of the client, as
	well as features it supports. Going forward, most of the contents of the message will be obsoleted.
	A short exchange of methods will the occur at the end of which the client should be able to join
	a chat channel with other players, join	an existing game, or create a new game.</p>

<h4>A messaging sequence diagram for the initial <em>client/server handshake</em> can be found <a href="">here</a>.</h4>

<p style="display: none">Upon receiving the SOCVersion message from the client, the server responds with its own SOCVersion
	message, followed by an SOCChannels message indicating what chat channels are available, and then
	an SOCGamesWithOptions message indicating what games are available to be joined. It is possible
	that either or both of these messages will have no content, but the messages must be sent and
	received. This completes the client/server handshake.</p>

<h3><em>Option Discovery</em> phase (optional)</h3>
<p>To create a new game	the client must first discover what game options the server supports so it
	can create a UI allowing a player to select options and maybe change some default values. This
	<em>option discovery</em> phase begins when the client sends an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCGameOptionGetDefault.html">SOCGameOptionGetDefault</a> message
	to the server. If the client knows some of the options and their default values it can include a
	list of those options in the message. The server will respond with a list of those options and
	their defaults that it supports and which were not listed in the client message, as well as
	other information useful to the client to allow the user to create a new game.</p>

<p>Current known options and their defaults are described in the Javadocs for the
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/game/SOCGameOptionSet.html">SOCGameOptionSet</a>
	class. Option keys that begin with "_SC_" are options specific to a game scenario.
	To learn more about game option properties, consult the Javadocs associated with the
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/game/SOCGameOption.html">SOCGameOption</a> class.</p>

<p>At the end of the <em>option discovery</em> phase the client should have all the information
	required to show the user a dialog to create a new game. The client will present a list of all
	scenarios, known to the server, for the user to select when creating a new game.</p>
<h4>A description and messaging sequence diagram for the <em>option discovery</em> phase can be found <a href="options.html">here</a>.</h4>

<h3><em>Game Creation</em> phase</h3>
<p>Once the user has selected the desired options (or has accepted the defaults) and selected a
	scenario if desired, the client will begin the <em>game creation</em> phase by sending an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCNewGameWithOptionsRequest.html">SOCNewGameWithOptionsRequest</a>
	message to the server requesting that a new game be created with the selected options.</p>
<!--
Client - SOCNewGameWithOptionsRequest:nickname=User|password empty|host=	|game=test
	|opts=_SC_FOG=f,BC=t3,_SC_SANY=f,_SC_3IP=f,NT=f,PLB=f,N7=t7,_SC_PIRI=f,
	_SC_CLVI=f,_SC_SEAC=f,SC=,_SC_FTRI=f,RD=f,_SC_WOND=f,PLP=f,_SC_0RVP=f,VP=f10,
	N7C=f,SBL=f,PL=4
-->
<p>When the game server creates a new game it will send an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCNewGameWithOptions.html">SOCNewGameWithOptions</a>
	message to every client indicating that the new game was created, allowing those clients to
	update their lists of available games.</p>
<!--
Server - SOCNewGameWithOptions:game=test|param1=-1|param2=BC=t3,N7=t7,RD=f,PL=4
-->
<p>Typically the client will automatically send an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCJoinGame.html">SOCJoinGame</a>
	message to the game server immediately after completing  requesting to join the game that it just
	created. A client may postpone this request and join the game at a later time if desired.</p>

<h3><em>Join Game</em> phase</h3>

<p>To join an existing or newly created game the client will send an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCJoinGame.html">SOCJoinGame</a>
	message to the game server with a requested nickname and the name of the game it wishes to join.
	If the game server requires player authentication a password must also be included. The server
	will respond with a series of messages indicating which seats are available, and which "face"
	icon should be used for each player.

Example:


Server - SOCJoinGameAuth:game=test

	Join existing game sequence -

	IN - [connection-localhost-8880] null - SOCJoinGameAuth:game=new
	IN - [connection-localhost-8880] null - SOCStatusMessage:status=Welcome to Java Settlers of Catan!

	Remainder is identical for both cases:

	After the SOCJoinGameAuth message, the client is sent all relevant game and player information.

<h3><em>Initial Game Setup</em> phase</h3>
<p>(The player picks an open seat, and starts the game. The server selects a player at random to start,
	each player places a road and settlement.)</p>
<h4>A messaging sequence diagram for the initial game setup can be found <a href="">here</a>.</h4>

<h3><em>Play</em> phase</h3>
<p>At the beginning of each round the server will send an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCPlayDevCardRequest.html">SOCTurn</a>
	message to all clients indicating the seat number of the player whose turn it is to roll the dice,
	and setting the game state to <em>ROLL_OR_CARD</em>. The server will then send an SOCRollDicePrompt to
	every client to indicated that the designated client may now request a dice roll.</p>
<p>The designated client may now play a "Soldier" development card by sending an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCPlayDevCardRequest.html">SOCPlayDevCardRequest</a>
	message to the server, or may request that the server roll the dice by sending an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCPlayDevCardRequest.html">SOCRollDice</a>
	message.
</p>
<p>The game server's responses to each of these messages depends on the actions precipitated by the
	message.</p>

<h4>The <em>Play Soldier card</em> messaging sequence diagram for playing a "Soldier" development card
	card can be found <a href="knights.html">here</a>.</h4>
<p>Once the "dice" have been "rolled", the robber potentially moved, and resources distributed, the
	designated player can "spend" his or her resources to build roads, ships, settlements or cities,
	or to buy more development cards. In order to change the resources a client possesses it may trade
	with other players, or with the "bank." Trading and buying can occur in any order and any number
	of times until the client indicates its turn is over by sending an
	<a href="https://lpassey.github.io/JSettlers2-javadoc/soc/message/SOCEndTurn.html">SOCEndTurn</a>
	message to the server.
